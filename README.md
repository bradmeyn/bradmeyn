Hi, my name is Brad.
My background is finance, with a double degree in Business & Commerce from the University of Newcastle.
As part of my previous job I would build various tools with excel and wondered if I could also make web applications.

I started completing an online web development bootcamp before work each morning and became hooked. 
After trying to fit learning development around work and time with my family I have decided I want to pursue this as a career.

I have largely focused on learning frontend languages, becoming more familiar with HTML, CSS & Javascript. 
I am currently trying to become more comfortable making fully functional apps using Node.js/express & MongoDB.

My currently plan is to complete a tertiary qualification in computer science while I continue to grow my development skills.
