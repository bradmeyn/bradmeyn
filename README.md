## How I got into coding

Learning how to code was something I'd write on a yearly goals list as I thought I might be able to utilise it with my current job. I started taking some online courses before work every morning and really enjoyed it. I like learning new things & this is constant with development. There is also a satisfying feedback loop where you learn something new and then get to see it in action live on the web (or at least on localhost).

## Changing Careers

After sometime I decided to take the leap and change careers to become a software developer. My plan has been to understake further tertiary study whilst also  completing additional online courses to learn new technology and build up my personal portfolio. 

## Software Skills

I have mainly utilised frontend & javascript based languages such as Node.js. I also have some experience using Java & MySQL via university. My specific skills and techniques used can be found on the various pinned repositories for different projects.

My current goal is to focus on improving my React skills to make more advanced full stack applications, potentially including the use of Next.js. I would also like to mobile development either with Swift or React Native.
