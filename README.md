Hi, my name is Brad.
My background is finance, with a double degree in Business & Commerce from the University of Newcastle. I was interested in investing from a young age and was able to turn this enthusiasm into a successful career. My previous role as a Technical Advisor saw me take on significant responsbilities including running our advice documentation team and chair the businesses investment committee.

I like learning new things and that's what drew me to web development. I was curious how websites were made and thought I could potentially replicate some financial tools I made via spreadsheets in the past. I started taking some online courses before work and soon I was hooked. After a while of trying to juggle my existing job, family and development on the side I decided to take the leap and change careers.

I'm now in the process of building up my professional developer portfolio to showcase my skills. I have started pursuing additional tertiary education, recently completed a Graduate Certificate of Computer Science from Monash University scoring a High Distinction in each unit.
