# Welcome to my github

## Background

My background is actually  personal finance & investment management. I was interested in investing from a relatively young age which ultimatly put me on the path of helping others with their personal finances.

- Advanced Diploma of Financial Services
- Graduate Certificate of Computer Science

### In Progress
- Masters of Computer Science (Software Engineering)

## How I got into coding

"Learn to code" was something I would put each year on my new years resolutions. I had been curious how websites were made and I thought it might be possible to make some interactive tools for work. I started taking some online courses before work every morning and really enjoyed it. I like learning new things and this is constant with development. There is also a satisfying feedback loop where you learn something new and then get to see it in action live on the web (or at least on localhost).

## Changing Careers

After sometime I decided to take the leap and change careers to become a software developer. My plan has been to undertake further tertiary study whilst also  completing additional online courses to learn new technology and build up my personal portfolio. 

## Software Skills

I have mainly utilised frontend & javascript based languages such as Node.js. I also have some experience using Java & MySQL via university. Some of the technology I have used includes:

- HTML
- CSS & SASS
- Boostrap
- Javascript
- Node.js w/ Express
- MongoDb w/ Mongoose
- EJS
- MySQL
- Java
- React

My current goal is to focus on improving my React skills to make more advanced full stack applications, potentially including the use of Next.js to build static sites. I would also like to explore mobile development either with Swift or React Native.
